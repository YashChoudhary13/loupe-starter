# Decisions

Settled architectural choices and the reasoning behind them. **Read before changing anything structural.** If you believe a decision is wrong, say so and ask — do not silently reverse it.

Append new decisions as you make them. Format: what was decided, why, and what was rejected.

### D1 — The operator picks the category; nothing guesses it

Automatic classification was considered and rejected. An anklet and a chain bracelet are the same object at different lengths and cannot be told apart from a photograph. Folder-per-category and printed QR cards were also rejected — the first invites misfiling, the second adds work at the shoot.

Category is a single click from someone already looking at the image. Because each category owns its own SKU sequence, a misclassification produces a wrong SKU *and* corrupts the sequence for everything after it, so the cost of a wrong guess is high.

**Consequence:** the Drive folder needs no structure at all. One flat folder.

---

### D2 — SKU numbers come from an atomic counter, never from Shopify

`SELECT max(sku)` then `+1` is exactly what produced the live duplicate `RS221` on two different products. Shopify enforces no SKU uniqueness and will accept a collision silently. Drafts, deletions and in-flight writes all make a "current max" query lie.

**Implementation:** `sku_counters` table, one row per prefix, incremented with a single `UPDATE … RETURNING` inside the publish transaction. The console displays a *predicted* SKU; the authoritative one is allocated server-side at publish.

**Seed from the true max per prefix, not a row count** — the existing sequences have gaps (`RS218`, `RS220`, `RS222` are missing).

---

### D3 — The database is not optional

Considered dropping it to simplify. Rejected: it holds the SKU counters (D2), the work queue so a half-built listing survives a closed laptop, the colour vocabulary, prompt and version history, and the audit trail from product back to source photograph. Errors are perhaps a tenth of what it stores.

At ~300 products/month the row data is a few MB a year and runs on Supabase's free tier indefinitely.

---

### D4 — Cloudflare R2 for images, Supabase for data only

Supabase Storage free tier is 1 GB with 5 GB egress; R2 is 10 GB with **free unlimited egress**. On Supabase the 1 GB ceiling breaks in week one without a retention job. R2 gives roughly five weeks of slack even with no retention at all, which matters for a system nobody watches closely at first.

Bucket is **private**; access via presigned URLs only, because images sit in the bucket before they're published — including rejected versions and unreleased pieces.

**Superseded:** a Supabase Storage bucket named `images` was created first and abandoned. Delete it.

---

### D5 — `gpt-image-2`, pinned to a dated snapshot, at 2048×2048

The existing prompt was developed in ChatGPT, so staying in the same model family means enhanced images keep looking like the ones the team already approves. Switching to another provider would mean re-tuning and a visible seam in the catalogue between old and new products.

**Pin the dated snapshot**, never `chatgpt-image-latest` — that pointer moves with ChatGPT and the catalogue's look would drift silently over months.

2048×2048 is Shopify's own recommendation for square product images.

**Known trade-off:** a generative model redraws the whole frame, so fine chain links and stone facets are reinterpreted rather than photographed. Mask-and-composite (keeping the photographer's original pixels for the product and replacing only the background) is sharper and cheaper, and remains the fallback if zoom quality proves unacceptable. Keep the enhancer behind one interface so this can be swapped without touching anything else.

---

### D6 — The description lives in the theme, not on the product

Only the material varies across the six description bullets. Storing the material in a **metafield** and rendering the bullets in the theme means a wording change is one edit instead of a bulk update across 1,600+ products — and it stops reproducing the WhatsApp CSS classes currently embedded in the live catalogue.

---

### D7 — The console is the approval step; publish goes straight live

No Shopify draft stage. The operator sees the image, the resolved SKU and the price before pressing Publish, which is the approval. A "Save as draft" button remains as an escape hatch for uncertain pieces.

---

### D8 — Duplicate detection uses perceptual hashing, not a model

A learned similarity checker was rejected as insufficiently trustworthy. A perceptual hash is a fixed algorithm — the same image always produces the same fingerprint — and it only ever raises a *warning* before publish, never blocks or decides.

---

### D9 — Monochrome UI with exactly one accent colour

The interface is black / white / grey because the content is gold and silver jewellery: a neutral UI makes the product photographs the only colour on screen.

**One** accent (amber) marks "needs attention", and nothing else. A second accent would erode the first. Density is deliberately higher than the visual reference the design came from — the reference is a portfolio piece showing eight data points; this tool shows twenty-plus thumbnails and is driven by keyboard.

---

### D10 — Closed vocabularies are Postgres enums, not text + CHECK

`intake_status`, `error_class`, `draft_status`, `image_kind` and `app_role` are all fully
enumerated in the phase spec, so they are enum types. They generate real TypeScript union
types from `supabase gen types`, and widening one later is a single `ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE`.

**Rejected:** `text` + `CHECK`. Easier to narrow, but it produces `string` in TypeScript,
which defeats the "no `any` in domain logic" rule at exactly the points where a typo in a
status string would be most expensive.

---

### D11 — RLS is enabled on every table with zero policies

Not "RLS off because everything is server-side anyway". Every table has row level security
enabled and no policies at all, which in Postgres is a default deny: `anon` and
`authenticated` can read and write nothing. `service_role` bypasses RLS, so the server-only
client keeps full access.

That makes hard rule 7 structural rather than a habit — the browser client is harmless
because the database refuses it, not because we remembered to be careful. Table privileges
are additionally revoked so that a future migration adding one narrow policy cannot
accidentally expose a whole table.

`tests/rls.test.ts` asserts it, table by table, using the real publishable key.

**Consequence:** any screen that later needs direct browser reads must add a policy in its
own phase's migration and justify it. That is deliberate friction.

---

### D12 — Migrations are applied by a small script, not the Supabase CLI

`npm run db:push` reads `supabase/migrations/*.sql` in filename order and applies each in its
own transaction, recording versions in `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` — the same
table the CLI uses, so the two stay interchangeable.

**Rejected:** the Supabase CLI. It is not on the path, installing it pulls in a Docker-based
local stack, and `supabase link` wants a personal access token this project does not have.
For fourteen files that is more machinery than the problem deserves.

**Note:** `db:push` needs `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`, which was stale during Phase 1 — see the
Phase 1 entry in PROGRESS.md. The Phase 1 migrations were applied through the Supabase
Management API instead. `db:push` itself is therefore written but not yet exercised.

---

### D13 — Domain data is seeded by a migration; people are seeded by a script

Categories, SKU counters and materials are domain facts, identical in every environment, and
live in `supabase/migrations/20260728121100_seed_domain_data.sql`.

Who may sign in is not a domain fact. `app_users` is seeded by `npm run seed:admin`, which
reads `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL`. Baking a person's address into a migration would grant them access
to staging and production the moment those exist.

Both are idempotent.

---

### D14 — `reserved_sku` and `reserved_handle` are UNIQUE in the database

Beyond the atomic counter. The counter prevents two allocations returning the same number;
these indexes prevent a wrong number ever being stored, whatever produced it — a manual
correction, a bad backfill, a bug in a future phase.

`RS221` exists on two live products. Had this index existed, the second write would have
failed loudly instead of succeeding quietly. The unique `reserved_handle` is what makes
retry-by-handle (hard rule 2) safe.

---

### D15 — Two service-role-only introspection functions exist for the tests

`_loupe_function_source(name)` and `_loupe_schema_report()` let the test suite assert against
the **deployed** database rather than the migration files on disk. Those drift the moment
somebody edits something in the Supabase SQL editor, and the drift that matters most —
`next_sku` "simplified" into a SELECT then an UPDATE, an index dropped, RLS switched off to
debug something — is invisible in the repository.

They grant nothing: `service_role` can already read `pg_catalog`. `anon` and `authenticated`
are revoked.

---

### D16 — The concurrency test is proved against a known-broken control

A test that passes is only evidence if it would fail on a broken implementation.
`tests/fixtures/naive-counter.sql` is the SELECT-then-UPDATE counter that produced `RS221`,
and `npm run verify:sku-control` runs the identical 100-way load against both.

Measured: the shipped function returned 100 distinct numbers; the naive one returned **13**
distinct numbers for 100 products. Without the control, "100 distinct integers" is just a
number.

The fixture is never left loaded — `tests/schema.test.ts` fails if it is present.

---

### D17 — Colour names are normalised by a database trigger, not by the application

CLAUDE.md requires trim / collapse-spaces / Title Case on save. That runs in a `BEFORE INSERT
OR UPDATE` trigger calling `normalise_colour_name()`, so `UNIQUE (name)` genuinely means
"unique after normalisation".

Enforcing it in application code would hold only for writes that went through the
application. A backfill, a fix applied in the SQL editor, or a second phase's worker would
each reintroduce `rose gold`.
